This App Helps You to Find Images on Your Disk Based on an Uploaded File or Description Text
This application is designed to assist users in finding images stored on their disk by 
either uploading a reference file or using descriptive text. It leverages the power 
of machine learning models with clip openai to perform efficient and accurate image searches 
across multiple directories.

Main Code: desk.py (Open Source)
The core functionality of this application is contained within the desk.py file,
which is open-source. This means that developers are encouraged to modify 
and enhance the codebase according to their needs. Some of the possible modifications include:

Increase Multiple Thread Limit: Optimize performance by adjusting the thread limit
to handle more concurrent tasks.
Add Strong Batch Processing: Improve the batch processing capabilities 
to handle large volumes of images more efficiently.
Change UI: Customize the user interface to better suit your workflow or aesthetic preferences.
And Many More: The possibilities are endless; feel free to experiment and innovate!
